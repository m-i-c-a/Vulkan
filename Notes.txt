Culling the Battlefield: Data Oriented Design in Practice

> Old culling system had two cull trees. One for static objects (pre-computed) and one 
  for dynamic objects.
> New culling system is brute-force on linear arrays. Saw a 3x speed improvement over
  the old culling system.

> Use AoS when culling. See "rearrange the frustum planes slide"

> Enables occlusion culling via a prepass where occulders are rendered into a low-res
  zbuffer and objects rendered after are tested against zbuffer (early z test)
